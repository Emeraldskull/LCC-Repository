    structure of a link:
    <a> is an anchor and tells the browser to go somewhere
    href="filename" tells the browser where to go
    target="_blank" tells the browser to open it in a new blank tab
    <a>the visual element that becomes the link</a>

    notes: 
    * make sure the file is in the same folder as index.html and the filename is written correctly. 

    * no spaces are allowed in file names so use dashes instead: file-name.html
